# Silverstripe

If you're completing the challenge in Silverstripe, we have included a
docker-compose.yml file so that you can get started quickly.

You will need the latest version of Docker installed and then running
`docker-compose up -d` should get everything up and running for you.

You can then access the site at `localhost:8080`
