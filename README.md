# News Feature

## Intro

This Webflow activity is a way for you to show us your Webflow skills -
we’re just as interested in how you think through a problem and approach
designing a solution as we are in the site you build.

Please give this page a read through as soon as possible, and ask any 
questions you might have via email.

⚠️ To begin work, you will need to let us know your Webflow user email address 
so we can transfer a blank project to you. This site includes the collection 
you will need to complete the task but nothing more.

### Before we come back together

Spend up to an hour working on the brief. We do not expect this entire
task to be completed during this time. Whatever you get done in this
time is OK with us.

### When we come back together

We will spend time reviewing what you have completed. We will be discussing
your technical choices and progress. After that, you will be pairing with 
another of our Webflow developers to extend the work you have already 
completed.

## Brief

The site we are building today is the first part of a fictional client
website. The client will use Webflow to manage the website after initial 
development by us. They need us to build the home page, and implement 
the News feature.

- Build a home page to a provided Figma specification, including a preview of
  the most recent news articles
- Build a news article page that shows a single news article in full as
  specified in the Figma file
- The site should work at both Webflow's "Desktop" and "Mobile Portrait" breakpoints. Where no mobile design is available, use your own experience and intuition
  to create a mobile appropriate design.

_We may or may not build all of this and that's totally fine._

### Specifics

- Create a copy of this template site: <TODO>
- Follow the design in the provided Figma file
- Send us a link to the site before we get back together
  - If you have passworded the site, make sure you tell us the password
- Remember that the project goal is to deliver a website that the client can 
manage on their own.

Use whatever methodology will help you get the job done. We might have a 
conversation about the choices you make, so it’s great if you have a solid 
reason for them.

### Assets

* You can export many assets from the Figma file
* For placeholder photos, use a service like [Picsum Photos](https://picsum.photos/)
* For placeholder text, use a service like [Lorem Ipsum](https://loremipsum.io/)

## What we’re looking for

- A working website hosted on Webflow
- An understanding of how your work has met the client goal
- A good idea of the decisions you have made while building this. Why
  you did it *this way* and not *that way* and what that means. What are
  you locking yourself into and what are you deferring to later. What is
  going to matter for ongoing performance, scalability, extensibility,
  robustness.

## What we’re not looking for, as much

- Heavy use of Javascript. While Webflow can be extended though Javascript
the requirements of this task are not intended to require such effort. Instead,
focus on building a fit-for-purpose website.


## Extension

In case you're wondering ... if we have time, here's a few things we might do 
to extend the site in our pairing session:

- Finish part of the initial build
- Create a news index page showing all news, with pagination
- Make the news searchable
- Show used tags on the news index page and let users show/hide matching
  articles
- Add "highlighted" articles on the home page in addition to the most recent

_Again, you are not expected to complete extension tasks on your own time. 
Just keep this in mind as background, to maybe help guide decisions you 
might make._
